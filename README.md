# Countdown-App
A simple countdown app built in android studio using java.

A user can enter a number of minutes to countdown from. The app works in the background and handles orientation changes. 
At any time a user can pause and reset the timer. The app was tested on both a virtual and physical device.

The user interface can be seen below.
